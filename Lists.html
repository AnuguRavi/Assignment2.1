    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li> 1tbs butter</li>
      <li>2tbs Cream</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Method</h2>
     <ol type="1">
       <li> Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
       <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
       <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
       <li>Using a spatula hold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omlette)</li>
       <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat(it will continue to cook on the plate until served) </li>

     </ol>
